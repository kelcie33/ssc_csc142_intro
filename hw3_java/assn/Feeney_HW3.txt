Here are the steps of testing the birthday game.  They are automatically tested by the program using a Scanner object to simulate the user input on the console.

		String testInputs1 = "Kelcie 2 27 3 28";
		String testInputs2 = "Kelcie z z 2 27 -1 3 28";
		String testInputs3 = "Kelcie 3 28 3 28";
		String testInputs4 = "Kelcie 4 1 3 28";


These are in sequence that the program would read them.  They are expected to have the same results, since the program repeats requests if the value is invalid.  The output is shown below.  The first group is with normal input (real user).  The second and third groups are with test inputs (testInputs1-4).
