/*
 * Reflections: This assignment was a great introduction to Java programming. 
 * This assignment took me around 20 to 30 minutes to complete.
 * From my personal experience, the hardest part was setting up the initial files.
 * Arranging the methods and strings was not as hard as I had expected it would be. 
 * In my opinion, the main point of this exercise was to learn and practice proper
 *  escape sequences.
